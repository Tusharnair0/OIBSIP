# OIBSIP Task: ATM and Online Test Interface

Project Overview

This project, completed for the Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship Program - Java Internship, implements two interactive interfaces:

ATM Interface:
-User Registration: Allows users to create new accounts with secure login credentials.
-User Login: Enables registered users to access their accounts.
-Deposit: Facilitates depositing funds into the user's account.
-Withdrawal: Permits cash withdrawals, ensuring sufficient balance and adhering to withdrawal limits.
-Transfer: Enables transferring funds between accounts for registered users.

Online Test Interface:
-User Login: Provides a secure login mechanism for registered users.
-Online Test: Presents a timed test with questions.
-Test Submission: Allows users to submit their completed tests within the allotted time.

Technologies Used
-Java: The primary programming language for building the application's core functionality.
-Libraries/Frameworks (Optional): Consider incorporating suitable libraries (e.g., Swing, JavaFX) for a more user-friendly graphical interface (GUI), or database technologies (e.g., JDBC, JPA) for persistent data storage if the project scope necessitates it.
